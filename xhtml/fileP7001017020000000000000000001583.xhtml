<p id="P7001017020000000000000000001585" data-uri="M05_COHE5320_02_SE_C05.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001585" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/add85a7051b733a9a1f503268a4786137bd51832e">To understand how we got to where we were in 2014 (as I wrote this) we have to go back a few years. The story of the Global Financial Crisis begins with constantly rising, or inflating, housing prices in the United States (and Canada) between 1996 and 2006. This housing price bubble (you inflate soap bubbles with air; you inflate housing price bubbles with demand) led homeowners, real estate investors, mortgage lenders (a mortgage is a loan to buy a house), and financial institutions to take bigger and bigger risks. It seemed that house prices could only go up, and there was easy money to be made. Banks issued mortgages with no down payments to borrowers who really couldn’t afford them (called “sub-prime” mortgages), assuming that even if a borrower couldn’t make his payments, the bank could sell the house at an ever-rising price to recover the loan. Banks and other financial institutions bundled these mortgages together and sold them to investors. The investors who bought the bundled mortgages received the mortgage payments. The sale of these bundled mortgages provided more money for the financial institutions to provide even more mortgages, making it easier for house buyers to demand houses, which further inflated housing prices (the bubble just kept getting bigger).</p>

You would be rich tomorrow with no risk by going into debt today. There is a saying that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Did this housing market fit that saying?</p></div>
