Triggered by a stock market bubble that burst in 1929, economic activity collapsed. By 1933, 20 percent of the Canadian and U.S. workforce was unemployed, and output of products and services fell by more than 30 percent. There were 30 percent fewer products, including food, to sustain a population that kept increasing. The prices consumers paid for products and services fell by over 20 percent. While falling prices sound good to those of us used to rising prices, because of unemployment, wages were falling even faster. And falling prices for businesses are a disaster, as falling revenues make it harder to pay off existing debts, so there is less money to invest in expanding output or improving productivity. To make things worse, there were no government programs like employment insurance, welfare, health care, or the Canada Pension Plan to ease the suffering. The effects of the Great Depression lasted over a decade. It took until 1941, when the government began spending heavily on military production for World War II, for standards of living to return to 1929 levels.</p>

Youth unemployment rates in countries like Greece and Spain reached levels of 40–50 percent! Around the world, the slow recovery from the Global Financial Crisis has not improved employment possibilities for those under 25 years old.</p>

At the end of December 2013, more than five years later, that number had still not recovered to pre-crisis levels. Only 2.42 million under-25s were employed, and the youth unemployment rate has stayed around 14 percent, about twice as high as the overall unemployment rate.</p>
