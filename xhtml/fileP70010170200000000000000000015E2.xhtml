The circular flow model of economic life, <a class="xref" href="fileP70010170200000000000000000015E2.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000015E5" data-offlinesupport="yes"><span class="label">Figure </span><span class="number">5.1</span></a>, explains the microeconomic miracle of markets. It also plays an important role in macroeconomics. The model reduces the complexity of the Canadian economy to three players — households, businesses, and governments. Households and businesses interact in two sets of markets — input markets, where businesses buy from households the inputs they need to produce products and services, and output markets, where businesses sell their products and services to households. Government sets the rules of the game and can choose to interact, or not, in almost any aspect of the economy. When markets work well, self-interest and the invisible hand of competition coordinate the smart choices of households and businesses in both sets of markets.</p>

Beginning at the top, individuals in households sell or rent out their inputs — labour, capital, land, and entrepreneurial abilities — to businesses. In exchange, businesses pay households wages, interest, rent, and other financial rewards. These exchanges happen in input markets and determine your income. Businesses use those inputs to produce products and services to sell to households. In exchange, households use the income earned in input markets to pay businesses for their purchases. These exchanges happen in output markets and determine the value of all of products and services sold.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000015EC" data-uri="M05_COHE5320_02_SE_C05.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000015EC" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a9e4e5c6b64f5677793c5519def67b3974c6f6c56">At the end of the trip around the circle, households have the products and services they need, and businesses end up with the money. That sets the stage for the next trip around the circle, where businesses again buy inputs from individuals in households in exchange for income, then produce outputs that households buy — and the circular flow goes on.<span class="pagebreak" id="P70010170200000000000000000015ED" title="112" data-uri="M05_COHE5320_02_SE_C05.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000015ED" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span></p>
