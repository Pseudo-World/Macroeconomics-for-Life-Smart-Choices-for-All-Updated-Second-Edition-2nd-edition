The belief that market economies would always quickly self-adjust was based on work by Jean-Baptiste Say (1767–1832), a French economist and supporter of Adam Smith’s views on free trade and markets. <a class="keyword" epub:type="keyword" href="../xhtml/fileP70010170200000000000000000044F0.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000046EB" data-offlinesupport="yes">Say’s Law</a> claims that “supply creates its own demand.”</p>

Starting at the top, households <i>supply</i> inputs to businesses in exchange for money. Households sell their inputs in input markets because they want the money to <i>demand</i> products and services in output markets. When households spend all of the money earned in input markets to buy products and services in output markets, supply does create its own demand. The flow continues smoothly around the circle.</p>

Economic events were crying out for a better explanation of the ups and downs of business cycles, especially the “downs” of decreasing spending, output, and living standards, combined with unemployment and deflation.</p>
