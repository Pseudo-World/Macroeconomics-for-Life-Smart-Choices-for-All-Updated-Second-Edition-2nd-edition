<p id="P700101702000000000000000000164C" data-uri="M05_COHE5320_02_SE_C05.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000164C" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a48fdbff0e23458e19f941db3511656cd2e63840e">Since the time of Keynes, macroeconomics has made great gains in understanding how the economy works. Economists have learned from past experiences and have developed more sophisticated mathematical tools for extending Keynes’s insights about macroeconomic ups and downs. Economists have also developed sophisticated tools for extending Say’s insights, and for understanding the conditions under which markets adjust quickly and well and produce the miracle of the continuous, ever-changing production of the products and services we want. Luckily for you, since you are not trying to become an economist, you don’t have to master those mathematical tools.</p>

The disagreements between the followers of Say and those of Keynes about the fundamental macroeconomic questions continue today.</p>
<p id="P700101702000000000000000000164E" data-uri="M05_COHE5320_02_SE_C05.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000164E" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a413633bc2a3d85156a1f4be5dd50224435429492">Because there is no agreement, you will have to decide which answers make most sense to you. The answers are important because they could make the difference between economic prosperity and recession. Your personal economic success will be affected by the macroeconomic performance of the economy, and that performance is affected by government policies that will be put in place by the politicians you elect.</p>

The answers use the concepts of market failure and government failure from microeconomics.</p>
