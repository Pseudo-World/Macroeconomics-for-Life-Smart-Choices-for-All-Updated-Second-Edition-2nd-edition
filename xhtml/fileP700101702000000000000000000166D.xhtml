The author argues that “It is impossible to have a systemic failure of the financial markets without mistakes by government policy makers being the primary cause.” He goes on to claim that the Global Financial Crisis was not due to financial causes but was caused by faulty government policies. One approving quote on the book cover by Charles Koch — a billionaire supporter of the Republican Tea Party in the United States — says “our economic crisis was a failure not of the free market, but of the government.” The cure is for the government to keep its hands off, and let markets self-adjust.</p>
