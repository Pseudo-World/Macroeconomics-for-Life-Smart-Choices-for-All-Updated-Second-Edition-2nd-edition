I focus on these differences to make it easier for you to understand different views of the macro economy. But, as in most things in life, it’s not always a question of yes or no. There are also agreements between the camps, so the actual differences are not as extreme as I have described them.</p>

The difference are more a matter of emphasis, not black and white but shades of grey.</p>

When you read the “Yes — Markets Self-Adjust — Hands-Off” and “No — Markets Fail Often — Hands-On” answers to the fundamental macroeconomic question, don’t think about the answers as right or wrong. Think about them as exposing two distinct ways of looking at the macro economy, and as helping you decide how <i>you</i> are going to answer that fundamental macro question.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000016BB" data-uri="M05_COHE5320_02_SE_C05.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000016BB" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a804fcda7d09959258957098150a9fcbfea2d2c57">If my goal were to help you to become an economist, I would focus more on the agreements between macroeconomists. But my goal is to help you make smarter choices as a citizen. For that, you need to focus on the differences to be able to vote <i>yes</i> for one political party’s economic policies and <i>no</i> to the others’ policies.</p>
