Nominal GDP for 2013, for example, would include only products and services that were actually produced in 2013. Used products, or products produced in previous years but resold later, are not counted as part of nominal GDP. If you resell your 2013 Honda Civic in 2020, its value does not count towards nominal GDP in 2020.</p>

Nominal GDP is usually calculated for a period of one year. But economists calculate GDP continuously in order to track how the economy is doing. They provide estimates for each quarter (three months) of a year’s economic activity. These quarterly estimates are then added together at the end of the year to measure nominal GDP for that year.</p>
