<p id="P7001017020000000000000000001C15" data-uri="M06_COHE5320_02_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001C15" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a41a7aa0246d157343a667ddbba8185852b8af4af">If you put $100 in a savings account that pays 3 percent interest per year, at the end of the year you have $103. If you leave the money in the account, the second year you earn 3 percent again, but this time on the original $100 plus the $3 in interest from the previous year. In year three, you earn 3 percent interest on $106.09, and the compounding continues as long as you leave your money in the account. How long does it take to double your money?</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000001C16" data-uri="M06_COHE5320_02_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001C16" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a864e705cd1c5f747f8606e00c44868d3e1756c4d">Don’t worry — this is not a dreaded word problem from math class. There is a simple rule that answers the question and illustrates the compounded impact of small differences in growth rates. According to the <a class="keyword" id="P7001017020000000000000000001C17" data-uri="M06_COHE5320_02_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001C17" epub:type="keyword" href="../xhtml/fileP70010170200000000000000000044F0.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000046E5" data-offlinesupport="yes">Rule of 70</a>, the number of years it takes for an initial amount to double is roughly 70 divided by the annual percentage growth rate of the amount. For our $100 at 3 percent example, 70 divided by 3 equals 23.3 years to double — to reach $200. <a class="xref" href="fileP7001017020000000000000000001C11.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001C1E" data-offlinesupport="yes"><span class="label">Figure </span><span class="number">6.14</span></a> shows the Rule of 70 for growth rates of 1 to 10 percent.</p>

<p id="P7001017020000000000000000001C51" data-uri="M06_COHE5320_02_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001C51" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a30a8229720dddff980200b38c2c344ddbb7279ec">The Rule of 70 tells us that, with an average annual growth rate of 2 percent (see page <span class="pageref">151</span>) between 1926 and 2017, Canadian GDP per person doubles roughly every 35 years. That means that over the 91 years, real GDP per person increased somewhere between four and eight times. The actual number, which requires a bit more calculation, shows Canadian real GDP per person increased over 6 times between 1926 and 2017. We now have over 6 times more stuff per person than my grandparents had.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000001C52" data-uri="M06_COHE5320_02_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001C52" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a9c9046d99cb26556a452849c59f2e4554bfb11d8">If the growth rate over this entire time span had been 3 percent instead of 2 percent, real GDP per person would have increased over 10 times instead of 6. In other words, with a 3 percent growth rate, we would be almost twice as well off today as we are currently with our 2 percent growth rate. That’s almost double the material standard of living for a 1 percent difference in annual growth rates! The wonder of compounding comes from the long ­number of years the compounding is allowed to work. Compounding is the secret to the slogan many banks use: “You work hard for your money; make your money work hard for you.”</p>
