As a result, we are much better off than our grandparents and great-grandparents.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000001C7C" data-uri="M06_COHE5320_02_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001C7C" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ad08018b9c287e4d5e0c0a1bd1789181ca42e8558">What causes the increases in the quantity and quality of inputs? Competition — the same competitive forces of Adam Smith’s invisible hand! Business ­competition is about figuring out new ways to beat your rivals in the market. In the short run, businesses can earn profits by cutting costs, developing new technologies of production, inventing new products, exploiting economies of large-scale ­production, or finding new or cheaper sources of raw materials and resources.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000001C7D" data-uri="M06_COHE5320_02_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001C7D" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ae55173e28afcd47c792310014b459fea1fa836cf">Over longer periods of time, these competitive actions, which result from the endless quest for profits, make businesses and labour more productive and improve living standards and product choices for consumers. Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950) was a Harvard economist who saw that competitive actions of business “revolutionize the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of <a class="keyword" id="P7001017020000000000000000001C7E" data-uri="M06_COHE5320_02_SE_C06.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001C7E" epub:type="keyword" href="../xhtml/fileP70010170200000000000000000044F0.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000004538" data-offlinesupport="yes">creative destruction</a> is the essential fact about capitalism.” These competitive smart choices of businesses expand and transform the stock of inputs as we move around the circular flow from one year to the next.</p>

Typewriters were the victims of creative destruction from newer computer technology. What do you use today that you think will be the victim of creative destruction within the next five years?</p></div>

All economists agree that another unintended ­macroeconomic consequence of these productivity-improving smart choices are the ups and downs of the business cycles.</p>
