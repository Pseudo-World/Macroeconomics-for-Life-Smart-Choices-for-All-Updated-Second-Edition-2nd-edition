<p id="P7001017020000000000000000001FC0" data-uri="M07_COHE5320_02_SE_C07.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001FC0" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a71adede69c7933e67c01854610274fd02ad497a0">Some workers who are employed part-time would rather have a full-time job, but can’t find one. Statistics Canada calls these <i>involuntary part-time workers</i>, and keeps track of them, but they don’t show up in the official unemployment rate. As the Economics Out There story on page <a class="pageref" href="fileP7001017020000000000000000001FE0.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000001FE3" data-offlinesupport="yes">172</a> explains, during recessions businesses often try to hold on to experienced workers but cut back their hours, increasing involuntary part-time unemployment. And during expansions, involuntary part-time unemployment decreases as businesses restore full-time work before hiring new workers. These shifts between part-time and full-time work are not picked up in the unemployment rate — they are missed.</p>
