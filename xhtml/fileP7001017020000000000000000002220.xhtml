<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002226" data-uri="M07_COHE5320_02_SE_C07.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002226" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ad22c8618eeb928ec056ce82b2c5a37631c386117">Between 2006 and 2008 Alberta had among the lowest unemployment rates in Canada and the highest inflation rates. During the peak of the oil-driven boom in 2006, unemployment dipped as low as 3 percent, below Albertaâ€™s natural rate of unemployment (or equivalently, employment above full employment levels). The Alberta economy was growing quickly, and demand for labour was far greater than the supply. Businesses faced labour shortages. Even entry-level positions at Tim Hortons offered $18 an hour to attract scarce workers.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002227" data-uri="M07_COHE5320_02_SE_C07.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002227" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a051276c16489b914550430e164acd19cc8d2a6e1">Demand was so great, and wages so high, that workers from as far away as the Maritimes moved to Alberta to take the higher-paying jobs. But there was a trade-off. While unemployment was low, prices were rising. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed an inflation rate for Alberta in 2006 of 3.9 percent, almost twice the national inflation rate of 2 percent.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002228" data-uri="M07_COHE5320_02_SE_C07.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002228" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a324bf850ba07c3b860ba2c8dff53ddbe3cd4c0da">The Alberta experience is not unique. There is often a trade-off between unemployment and inflation. In countries around the world, situations with low unemployment often trigger high inflation, and situations with high unemployment are often associated with low inflation.</p>
