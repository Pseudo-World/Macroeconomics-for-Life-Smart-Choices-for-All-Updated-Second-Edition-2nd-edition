The adjustment stories for the “No” camp to a recessionary gap example are very different from the “Yes” camp for the input, output, international trade, and loanable funds markets.</p>

<p id="P70010170200000000000000000028A6" data-uri="M08_COHE5320_02_SE_C08.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000028A6" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a2a4ddc5628d7aa5727b32bd74f3ecd93c5cd95ab">In labour markets, wages don’t fall often or easily. Economists describe these as <i>sticky wages</i>. It is much easier to raise wages than to cut them. There are many reasons for sticky wages. Union and other contracts can’t be quickly changed. Workers resist having their wages and incomes reduced. Employers also resist wage cuts so as not to demoralize workers, hurt productivity, or lead employees to start looking elsewhere for jobs.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000028A7" data-uri="M08_COHE5320_02_SE_C08.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000028A7" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a6332410b5afda26315d96a5a94f8aa11d5fde5e1">When prices don’t adjust, quantities do. Unemployment is a quantity adjustment in labour markets. Workers and employers accept layoffs instead of lower wages in response to a negative demand shock.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000028A8" data-uri="M08_COHE5320_02_SE_C08.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000028A8" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a8eb1920742d33b453fea15da215e9d3c0292674c">The “No — Markets Fail Often” camp argues layoffs in labour markets mean less income for workers to spend, which decreases demand for products and ­services in output markets. Falling output prices from unsold goods may not be enough to restore sales in output markets. The “No” camp sees the connections between input and output markets as slowing market adjustments to a negative demand shock. It may take a long time to restore employment and output to the target level of potential GDP.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000028A9" data-uri="M08_COHE5320_02_SE_C08.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000028A9" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ad4f21e916c32d089e591a098c6c02684f3d9295f">In international trade markets, the “No” camp worries about the destabilizing effects of fluctuating Canadian exports due to business cycles in R.O.W. These additional demand shocks from R.O.W. may be worse than the stabilizing role of price adjustments in export and import markets.</p>

On its own, an increase in saving — the supply of loanable funds — puts pressure on interest rates to fall. But if the increase in saving is caused by more pessimistic expectations about the future, then business investment spending may <i>decrease</i>, not increase, even if interest rates fall. This is actually what happened during the Global Financial Crisis. For the “No” camp, expectations are more important than interest rates in influencing business investment spending.<span class="pagebreak" id="P70010170200000000000000000028AD" title="232" data-uri="M08_COHE5320_02_SE_C08.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000028AD" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span></p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000028AE" data-uri="M08_COHE5320_02_SE_C08.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000028AE" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/adf2f9798fe1832e27b462f97b99bd9a6c17e1ff5">With internally generated shocks regularly causing business cycles, and with weak or slow price adjustment mechanisms, the “No — Markets Fail Often” camp sees an obvious role for government in market economies: the thermostat needs adjusting and only government can do it. Government fiscal and monetary policies can be used to counter the shocks that have triggered recessionary or inflationary gaps. Government action is necessary to bring short-run aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the economy back into balance to hit the ­macroeconomic performance targets.</p>
