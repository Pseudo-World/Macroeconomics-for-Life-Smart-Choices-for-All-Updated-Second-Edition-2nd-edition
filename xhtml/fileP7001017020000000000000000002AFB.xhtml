In a world where Say’s Law holds true, aggregate supply and aggregate demand match, plans work out as expected, and all savings that are put into the loanable funds market earn interest. Those funds are then borrowed by businesses for investment spending. In this world of Say’s Law, even without inflation, why would anyone store their wealth in the form of money? In <i>The General Theory of Employment</i>, Keynes said “ … it is one of the recognised characteristics of money as a store of wealth that it is barren; whereas practically every other form of storing wealth yields some interest or profit. Why should anyone outside a lunatic asylum wish to use money as a store of wealth?”</p>
