<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002B29" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002B29" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a850495b59bc5a85ef020ba4e385d496df366e9bb">What about the store of value function of money? You will hold enough of your wealth as money to be able to make your regular purchases, but will you also hold money (instead of bonds) as a store of value, that is, as savings? Here the “Yes — Markets Self-Adjust” and “No — Markets Fail Often” camps give different answers.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002B2A" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002B2A" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a3a8d6098fe029133080b24a850750da0b6b0eddf">Let’s look first at a “Yes — Markets Self-Adjust” scenario, where supply creates its own demand, and aggregate supply and aggregate demand match. Investors have rational expectations, and savings can be relatively safely and predictably invested to earn interest. In this scenario, there is not much demand for money as a store of value. People will hold more of their wealth as interest-paying bonds. Savings, which reduce aggregate demand, are put into bonds (loanable funds), which causes the interest rate to fall, increasing business investment spending. Ford buys new robots for its factories with the $10 000 you loaned the car-maker in exchange for its bond. The additional investment spending increases aggregate demand and offsets the saving, so the economy continues to operate at potential real GDP with full employment. Even with money and saving, supply continues to create its own demand.</p>

When there is fundamental uncertainty about the future and volatile expectations, people hold more of their wealth as money. With the unpredictability of recessions, interest-earning bond investments are risky, not safe.</p>

The 158-year-old Lehman Brothers investment bank was the most publicized of these bankruptcies. All those who invested money in Lehman Brothers lost their savings. Similarly, when Chrysler and General Motors went briefly into bankruptcy in 2009, bondholders of those corporations lost much of their invested money — the money they loaned those businesses through buying their bonds.</p>

Earning no interest may be better than losing your savings with risky investments in the loanable funds market. During the Global Financial Crisis, most investors wished they had been holding money instead of equities and bonds whose value plunged by 40 percent during the trough of the business cycle. Investors (like Joseph Kennedy, father of U.S. president John F. Kennedy) who switched to cash before the stock market crash of 1929 that started the Great Depression became the wealthy elite of the 1930s.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002B3F" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002B3F" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/af081097011d67decb560810d03f018d28f8efbae">In Keynes’s world, holding money is like a security blanket, protecting the holder from unpredictable economic changes. The more worried investors are, the higher the interest rate they will demand to let go of the security blanket and move their wealth from money to loanable funds. Fear about the future causes interest rates to rise, which discourages investment spending by businesses and intensifies the recession. Pessimistic expectations can become self-fulfilling expectations — they help create the negative outcome investors are worrying about.</p>

The “No — Markets Fail Often” camp places more emphasis on the security of money as a store of value protecting you against future uncertainty.</p>
