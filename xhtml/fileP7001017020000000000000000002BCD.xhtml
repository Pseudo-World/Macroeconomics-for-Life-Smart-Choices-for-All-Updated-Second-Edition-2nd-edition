Commodity money is exactly what its name says — a commodity such as fur pelts, beads, cattle, or precious metals used as money. Commodity money has alternative uses. Gold and silver, for example, are used for jewellery and industrial purposes, as well as for coins. To be useful as a medium of exchange and as a unit of account, commodity money must be easy to carry, to measure, and to divide into fractions. That’s why cattle and fur pelts are inferior forms of commodity money compared to coins (loonies, quarters, dimes, etc.). As a store of value, commodity money must not deteriorate over time. Coins also work well as a store of value. But imagine trying to use sticks of butter as money in a tropical climate. As your savings melted, your money would literally go down the drain.</p>

They were found by archaeologists in the Temple of Artemis in what is now Turkey. After that, coins quickly became the dominant form of commodity money.</p>
