They have value simply because the government decrees that they are valuable. Money that has no alternative uses and is valuable simply by governmental decree (a fiat) is called fiat money. The bills and the coins made from mylar and non-precious metals that we use are fiat money. Economists also refer to the government-issued bills and coins in circulation as <a class="keyword" id="P7001017020000000000000000002BDE" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002BDE" epub:type="keyword" href="../xhtml/fileP70010170200000000000000000044F0.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000004541" data-offlinesupport="yes">currency</a>.</p>

Currency — the bills and coin fiat money we use — is acceptable because we trust the government that issued it. If you look at any bill in your wallet, you will see that it is “signed” by the Governor of the Bank of Canada, who decrees that “Ce billet a cours légal — This note is legal tender.” Similarly, the playing card money in the opening photograph of the chapter was also fiat money. Its acceptability depended on its being signed by Governor of New France, who was trusted.</p>
