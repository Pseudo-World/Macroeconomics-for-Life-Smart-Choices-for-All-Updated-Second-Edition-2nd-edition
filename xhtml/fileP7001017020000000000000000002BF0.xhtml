Typically, the government delayed paying merchants for products until a fresh supply of gold and silver coins arrived from France. But he could not delay paying his soldiers. De Meulles’s clever solution was to issue paper money printed on playing cards.</p>

<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002BF7" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002BF7" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a5f35d05ad8e010604a3d34e6feb143c18ef166fd">“I have found myself this year in great straits with regard to the subsistence of the soldiers. You did not provide for funds, my Lord …. Money being extremely scarce … for the pay of the soldiers, it occurred to me to issue, instead of money, notes on cards, which I have cut in quarters … I have issued an ordinance by which I have obliged all the inhabitants to receive this money in payments, and to give it circulation, at the same time pledging myself, in my own name, to redeem the said notes.”</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002BF8" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002BF8" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a7dd1424154054282fca0f3f59fe8fbb52cfaf10b">These cards were widely accepted by merchants, given that they were backed by the government. Even though the cards were redeemable for gold, many were not redeemed and remained in circulation as money.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002BF9" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002BF9" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/abd649bfd680b73addc317dfcd6cf63e53471105f">Playing card money was fiat money. It was valuable by the decree of the government, and functioned as a medium of exchange because of its acceptability by sellers, who trusted the government and obeyed the government decree.</p>
