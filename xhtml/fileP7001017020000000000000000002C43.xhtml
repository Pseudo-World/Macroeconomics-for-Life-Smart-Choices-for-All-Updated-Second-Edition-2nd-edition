<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002C46" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002C46" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a1db5dac0b8fbda03ca03fd274d291dd49056bbb8">To explore how banks create money, let’s start with a simple story. Suppose someone gives you $1000 cash to hold. His “offer” is that it will be very unpleasant for you (you might lose a kneecap or other body part) if you don’t return the money when he asks for it. He will be back sometime within 10 days. On any day there is a 1/10 chance he will ask you for the money. You have no choice but to hold the money in a form (cash) that you can give back.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002C47" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002C47" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a5c458f5e00293ee941db4665046c3c9d0435af86">Now suppose 100 people each give you $1000 on the same terms. Then on any day, what is the probability — the odds — of your having to give out the whole $100 000? It is (1/10)<sup>100</sup>, which is a very, very, very, very small number. Those tiny odds of being asked for all of the money depends on the probabilities being independent — the likelihood of one person asking for her money is not influenced by whether any of the other people ask for their money. This will be important.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002C48" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002C48" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a7393e6f83c78ecffd2b763c4c0086d6b649cc39d">If you want to play it safe, the probability of being asked for more than $80 000 on any given day is even smaller. You would be quite safe holding $20 000 in reserve and loaning out $80 000 to other people and collecting interest. By making loans, you can profit from other peoples’ money.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002C49" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002C49" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a4fc3f1851a8082e2b4b1a3ec34b40140be95c859">This simple story contains all of the main features of banking — deposits ($100 000), loans ($80 000), and reserves ($20 000).</p>
