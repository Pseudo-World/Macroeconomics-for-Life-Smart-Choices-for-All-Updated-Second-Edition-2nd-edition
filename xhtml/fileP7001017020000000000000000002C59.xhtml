When you or any other depositor put money into a chartered bank, you get a credit on your chequing account balance. If you deposit $1000 cash, you can use your debit card to pay for products and services worth up to $1000. But the bank doesn’t keep your cash in their vaults. They keep a very small fraction of your deposit in the form of cash reserves, and loan out the rest at interest. Like the goldsmiths, the banks are banking on the very small probability that depositors and borrowers would all want to withdraw their cash at the same time. This system of banking is called <a class="keyword" id="P7001017020000000000000000002C5D" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002C5D" epub:type="keyword" href="../xhtml/fileP70010170200000000000000000044F0.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000045B1" data-offlinesupport="yes">fractional-reserve banking</a>.</p>

Since demand deposits are money — part of <span class="inlineequation"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" alttext="" data-uri="" altimg-width="620" altimg-height="22" altimg="../images/ch09_altmath_10.png"><mrow><mtext>M</mtext><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo></mrow></math></span> — the bank has created both a loan and money. When loans are paid off, there is a reduction in the quantity of both loans and money. In the Canadian monetary system, loan creation and money creation are two sides of the same coin. By loaning money, chartered banks are legally creating money, without counterfeiting.</p>
