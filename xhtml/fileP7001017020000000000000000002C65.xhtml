Canadian banks actually hold less than 1 percent of the value of all demand deposits as cash!</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002C68" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002C68" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/af5d650dcb183ab20f99681a56b880ba8989219e2">Nonetheless, the Canadian banking system is one of the safest and most admired banking systems in the world. There are many reasons for this, but we will focus on just a few related to the basics of deposits and loans. First, most bank customers rarely demand cash. Think about the small proportion of bills or purchases that you pay for with currency. Second, in the rare event that customers want to withdraw more demand deposits or currency than the bank has, chartered banks can borrow from each other and from the Bank of Canada (the lender of last resort) to meet their customersâ€™ demands and maintain trust.</p>
