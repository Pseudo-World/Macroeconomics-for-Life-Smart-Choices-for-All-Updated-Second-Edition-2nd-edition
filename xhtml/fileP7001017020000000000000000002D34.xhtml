<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002D36" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002D36" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/add8970f902878c25c50a8da731e2f38439ee9ee0">I always talk about “the” interest rate, as though there is only one. In fact, there are many interest rates on different financial assets, different forms of loanable funds. Interest rates vary depending on the time periods for repaying the original amount (long-term investments like 30-year bonds usually have higher interest rates than short-term investments), the riskiness of the investment, and how liquid the investment is (how easy is it to sell). There are also interest rates on mortgages, on consumer loans, on credit cards, and on savings accounts — there are many interest rates.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002D37" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002D37" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/aad3d703dd2b9d28f94eee09c8d04b3aafa23d06d">While there are many interest rates, they all tend to move together — to rise at the same time, and to fall at the same time. So the stories about how “the” interest rate is determined apply generally to all interest rates.</p>
