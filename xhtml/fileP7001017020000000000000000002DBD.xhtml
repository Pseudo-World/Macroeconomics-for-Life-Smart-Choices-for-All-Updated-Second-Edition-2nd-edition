<p id="P7001017020000000000000000002DC0" data-uri="M09_COHE5320_02_SE_C09.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002DC0" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a84fbabc15743b876a0c64c84aace32f77ece0266">Money makes the biggest difference for the loanable funds market. When worried consumers and businesses stop spending and increase their saving, they may <i>not</i> put their saving into loanable funds markets, and businesses may postpone investment spending even if interest rates are low. Consumers and businesses hold money instead to calm their unease and reduce risk. The domestic monetary transmission mechanism — whereby falling interest rates in the loanable funds market increase spending and aggregate demand — gets blocked by money. It may take years for markets to adjust mismatches between aggregate supply and demand. Without government help, the economy falls short of potential real GDP and full employment.</p>
