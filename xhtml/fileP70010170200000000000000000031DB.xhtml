<p id="P70010170200000000000000000031DD" data-uri="M10_COHE5320_02_SE_C10.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000031DD" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a845eb78b31641fbbe2d60c426d80f8a90a59abed">Most of the demand for and supply of foreign currencies, including the Canadian dollar, comes from speculators. Every day, foreign currencies worth about US$5 trillion are traded on the foreign exchange market. The daily trade in products and services is worth only about US$50 billion. That means speculative currency trading is 100 times more important than currency trading for buying products and services! Speculators try to make profits by buying low and selling high. They hope to buy Canadian dollars when the exchange rate is low and sell when the exchange rate is high. If a speculator bought US$1 million worth of Canadian dollars at a price of US$0.63, and sold at a price of US$0.93, she would make a profit of US$300 000! Many fortunes have been made, and lost, on the foreign exchange market.</p>
