<p id="P70010170200000000000000000035DF" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000035DF" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ae5e263b19c52c386d504813bde9be55fd71d2b90">In our monetary economy, Say’s Law — supply creates its own demand — can break down if consumers stop shopping and start saving. Without enough spending, businesses find products sitting on shelves, and lay off workers. The economy plunges off the road into the bust of a recession. But if banks take those savings and lend them to businesses that increase their investment spending, Say’s Law can be saved. It is still possible that all income earned by suppliers in input markets is spent to create an equal demand for products and services in output markets.</p>

<p id="P70010170200000000000000000035E1" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000035E1" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/af9467c9b3acd3f8009b1f9ffc83ac893875372f7">Interest rates affect how much we, as consumers, homeowners, and business people, can afford to borrow and buy. When interest rates are lower, we can afford to borrow more and spend more, and we save less. When interest rates are higher, we can’t afford to borrow, so we spend less and save more. If savings flowing into the banking system cause interest rates to fall, encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow and spend more, this restores the match between aggregate supply and aggregate demand. The right interest rate can keep the economy on the road toward potential GDP.</p>

As part of the loanable funds markets, bond markets determine long-run interest rates, such as rates for 25-year mortgages and 10- to 30-year government bonds. Central banks cannot influence long-run interest rates, but they can influence short-run interest rates.</p>

That’s about as short run as it gets! The Bank of Canada’s target for the overnight rate is also called the policy interest rate, which then determines <i>all other</i> interest rates that banks charge their customers. The policy interest rate directly affects rates on lines of credit, rates for consumer and car loans, and rates for variable mortgages.</p>
