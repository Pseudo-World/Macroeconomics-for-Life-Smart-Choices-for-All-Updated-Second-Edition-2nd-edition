<p id="P70010170200000000000000000037AC" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000037AC" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a9f0f594a52aa668aac9266ab7c2943fb842cc9d6">Monetary policy is not always politically popular. Consumers and businesses are usually pleased when the Bank of Canada lowers interest rates to fight a recession. But when economic growth speeds up, with more jobs, more profits, and more income, the Bank of Canada raises interest rates — raising the cost of mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing. People complain, especially because they can’t see any inflation in the present. But the Bank of Canada is concerned that, 18 to 24 months in the future, continuing growth will cause inflation to rise beyond the target range. One central banker describes his job as “taking away the punch bowl just when the party is getting started.” Not a popular move. But successful monetary policy is about moderation — accelerating the economy when it is slowing, and braking the economy when it is speeding up.</p>

The problem is that if central bankers delayed their policy response until inflation actually appeared in the data, it would be too late to have the desired impact. Being forward-looking means anticipating where the demons will surface and acting in a pre-emptive manner.</p></blockquote>
