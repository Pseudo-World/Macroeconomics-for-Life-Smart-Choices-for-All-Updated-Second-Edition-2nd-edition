<p id="P70010170200000000000000000037D4" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000037D4" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/aaa3fdabd0a489af3f615a81d7d90f4c8fc43c2c3">The Global Financial Crisis led the Bank of Canada to dramatically change its driving habits. The threatened collapse of the banking system was so serious, and fears of repeating the Great Depression of the 1930s were so real, that central bankers abandoned their conservatism and stepped on the accelerator as hard as they could.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000037D5" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000037D5" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a1f8d28581874f2445f28bcc46338d7abcc77ae5c">From a target overnight rate of 4 percent at the start of 2008, the Bank of Canada began aggressively cutting interest rates. There were unusually large 50 basis point cuts in March 2008, April 2008, and October 2008, lowering the overnight rate to 2.5 percent. Just two weeks later in October (breaking the eight-dates-a-year tradition) the Bank of Canada cut another 25 basis points, followed by an unprecedented 75 basis-point cut in December 2008, bringing the overnight rate down to 1.5 percent. These actions were the equivalent of a conservative banker wearing a pink polka dot suit!</p>

The Bank of Canada kept the overnight rate at 0.25 percent until mid-2010.</p>
