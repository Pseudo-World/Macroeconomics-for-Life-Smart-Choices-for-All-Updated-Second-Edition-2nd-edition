<p id="P70010170200000000000000000037F8" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000037F8" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/aee748e593370234f45b8847264ffa8944939bb1f">The Bank of Canada’s monetary policy — buying bonds from individuals and banks — pumped lots of cash into chartered banks’ reserves. In pursuing profits, banks would normally use the new reserves to make more loans, create more demand deposits, and increase the money supply.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000037F9" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000037F9" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a2d0c7858320d097410494c444db119b965b8b12b">But banks were also suffering from falling asset prices, desperately trying to repair their balance sheets by increasing assets. Banks held on to new cash reserves to protect against the growing number of borrowers who were going bankrupt and defaulting on — not paying back — their loans. Chartered banks did not increase their lending as the Bank of Canada hoped. They kept the extra cash reserves as assets. Banks chose prudence over profits. Pessimistic expectations about loan repayments and economic conditions had more effect than the attraction of potential profits from new loans.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000037FA" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000037FA" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ac9205331ca5707655b103c67bd990d6731cf8621">Banks in Canada and the United States hesitated to lend money, except to the most creditworthy customers. In the U.S., banks refused to renew mortgages, even for homeowners who had never missed a mortgage payment and had perfect credit histories.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000037FB" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000037FB" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ac8b8da3af452db9923956fe998463390ab59e3ef">Ironically, in the U.S. housing boom that led up to the 2008–2009 recession, banks chose profits over prudence, lending money even to those who were not credit-worthy (sub-prime mortgages). Those loose lending practices helped create the housing bubble that triggered the Global Financial Crisis. After the housing bubble burst, banks chose prudence over profits, and the restrictive lending practices, which limited spending, made the recession deeper and longer lasting. The banking system contributed to the cycle of boom and bust.</p>
