That accomplishment earned him <cite>Time Magazine’s</cite> 2009 Award as Person of the Year.</p>
<p id="P700101702000000000000000000382D" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000382D" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a857e999eb3eb0e3d4f14b0fe8a7fa3ba77c018b8">In an interview, Bernanke said, “We came very, very close to a depression...The markets were in anaphylactic shock. I’m not happy with where we are, but it’s a lot better than where we could be.”</p>
<p id="P700101702000000000000000000382E" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000382E" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ab670b929f64fce686247c91a2d3887c66a9c491e">Many central banks followed Bernanke’s lead in implementing the innovative policy of quantitative easing. Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, described the policy this way: “People always talk about central banks taking away the punch bowl, but when demand was falling so rapidly, Ben had to put the punch bowl on the table and say, ‘Let’s party!’”</p>
<p id="P700101702000000000000000000382F" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000382F" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ab68d51b0558a0c6a8295bab2731d2536b03fe80d">Bernanke, an economics professor at Princeton University, had studied the monetary policy blunders of the Great Depression, and “was determined not be the Fed Chairman who presided over Depression 2.0.”</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003830" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003830" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/afd9ea60bd61c79b2b18ac4b9c107f91129308dff">The story that captivated Bernanke as a child was about a town with many shoe factories that closed during the Depression, leaving the community so poor that its children went barefoot. “I kept asking, ‘Why didn’t they just open the factories and make the kids shoes?’” he recalls.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003831" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003831" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a3faabf5ecff748906c7eb2bee9ff319e83973c9c">Bernanke has devoted his career to questions like that: the same question that is posed at the start of <a class="xref" href="../xhtml/fileP700101702000000000000000000155F.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000155F" data-offlinesupport="yes"><span class="label">Chapter </span><span class="number">5</span></a> of this book — “Are your smart choices smart for all?”.</p>
