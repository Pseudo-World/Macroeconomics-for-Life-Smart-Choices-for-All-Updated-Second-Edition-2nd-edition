<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003854" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003854" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/aebb2aa09a3539e0dfe374b27ef28b9b3f693b90f">The Bank of Canada’s inflation control target range is 1 to 3 percent. This specific policy objective is set by agreement between the Government of Canada and the Bank of Canada. But the Bank of Canada <i>alone</i> sets the monetary policy for achieving that target. The Minister of Finance — for the government — and the Governor of the Bank of Canada jointly decide on the destination of Canada’s economic car, but the Governor gets to drive.</p>

Investors and markets like predictability, so governments do not like to quarrel publicly with a Governor of the Bank of Canada. A disagreement over monetary policy would cause stock market values to fall and investors to lose confidence in the stability of the financial system. “Who is in charge?” they would ask. This gives the Bank of Canada considerable independence, even though it is ultimately accountable to Parliament: a classic Canadian compromise between authority to act and accountability to the voters.</p>
