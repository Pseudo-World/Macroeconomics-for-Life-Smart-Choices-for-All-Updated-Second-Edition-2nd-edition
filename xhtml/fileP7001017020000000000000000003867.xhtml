<p id="P700101702000000000000000000386A" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000386A" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ad4d912f8e0b5cecf703ad3b9a0bc3036c5b8ccce">The original Philips Curve trade-off between inflation and unemployment works as long as people’s expectations of inflation do not change. Using monetary policy to lower interest rates and accelerate aggregate demand, a central bank can steer toward lower unemployment and higher inflation. But once higher inflation occurs, the gas pedal can stick to the floor — runaway inflation —  because of changing expectations.</p>
<p id="P700101702000000000000000000386B" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000386B" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a47313cb1d3e388006b2a9469a9ab42821cac869c">If people begin expecting inflation, it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consider this scenario: You are expecting the inflation rate next year to be 4 percent, and your employment contract is up for renewal. How much of a raise will you ask for?</p>
<p id="P700101702000000000000000000386C" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000386C" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ae02241652f073fbeb7491606ba84a9f79f02a748">If you are like most people, you will be thinking, “The cost of living next year will be 4 percent higher. Unless I get at least a 4 percent raise, my income won’t keep pace with the rising cost of living. My standard of living will go down. I’d better ask for at least a 4 percent raise.”</p>
<p id="P700101702000000000000000000386D" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000386D" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a3472df36e35fa13427e3481102922e86021ed21a">Once expectations of inflation begin, many people think the same way. Businesses expect higher prices for inputs, and set output prices higher to protect their profits. Banks expect inflation, and increase nominal interest rates on loans to protect the real rate of interest they will receive. When workers, businesses, and banks expect inflation, they reasonably try to protect themselves by pushing up wages, prices of output, and interest rates. This creates self-fulfilling expectations — by reacting to the expectation of inflation we may help cause it.</p>

Dramatically higher oil prices in the 1970s caused a negative supply shock (see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001017020000000000000000002781.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000002781" data-offlinesupport="yes"><span class="label">section </span><span class="number">8.4</span></a>). Most central banks, including the Bank of Canada, mistook the resulting contraction for a negative demand shock. They increased the money supply and lowered interest rates, trying to increase aggregate demand. But the decrease in aggregate supply from rising input prices combined with increased aggregate demand from expansionary monetary policy created rising prices. This led to greater expectations of continued inflation, which led to higher inflation in the 1980s. Once inflation expectations rose and central banks allowed the quantity of money to increase, higher rates of inflation were associated with higher levels of unemployment. The simple trade-off between higher inflation and lower unemployment that the original Phillips Curve showed for the 1950s and early 1960s no longer existed.

The prime lending rate in Canada peaked at over 19 percent in 1981. The result was a severe recession. <a class="xref" href="fileP7001017020000000000000000003867.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003881" data-offlinesupport="yes"><span class="label">Figure </span><span class="number">11.12</span></a> shows that this succeeded in bringing down actual inflation (as the quantity theory of money predicts), and expectations of inflation also fell. Notice also that since inflation targeting by the Bank of Canada began in 1991, inflation has stayed within the target range of 1 to 3 percent.</p>

Inflation expectations go up quickly and easily, but breaking (and braking) inflation expectations is slow and painful. It takes a long period of recession, with unemployment and depressed business sales, before everyone begins accepting more slowly rising wages and prices. For this reason, most economists and policymakers now agree that it is important to keep inflation rates low, stable, and predictable. An inflation target range accomplishes this by anchoring inflation expectations.</p>
