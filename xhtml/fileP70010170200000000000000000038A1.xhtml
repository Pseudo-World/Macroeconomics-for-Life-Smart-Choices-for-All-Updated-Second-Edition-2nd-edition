<p id="P70010170200000000000000000038A4" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000038A4" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a48b53b547f6f4a1863e0c28c23377b2b24384e65">The “Yes — Markets Self-Adjust” believers in Say’s Law favour a hands-off role for government. They believe that government failure is more likely than market failure. They support an independent central bank to keep monetary policy out of the hands of government politicians, including finance ministers. To keep the independent central bank as hands-off as possible, the “Yes” camp supports fixed rules for monetary policy, like targets, that leave no discretionary choices for central bankers.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000038A5" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000038A5" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/acc39059789eadfed740bddf7d7c06318f1b7fd81">Besides believing that markets quickly adjust to any external shocks, the “Yes, Hands-Off” camp points to the long delays before monetary policy has an effect. Those delays increase the chances that policymakers will get the timing wrong and do more harm than good with discretionary monetary policy. Suppose the central bank, expecting a recession, steps on the gas and lowers interest rates. If the economy is expanding by the time the economic car finally speeds up, the expansionary policy steers the car off the cliff into an inflationary boom that eventually turns into a bust. Better, the “Yes, Hands-Off” camp says, to leave the driving to the flexibility of markets.</p>

Without target rules, politicians may be tempted to allow a higher inflation rate to get lower unemployment. Macroeconomic players would lose confidence in a stable and predictable inflation rate. Once prices start rising, the gas pedal can stick to the floor because of changing expectations, leading to runaway inflation.</p>
