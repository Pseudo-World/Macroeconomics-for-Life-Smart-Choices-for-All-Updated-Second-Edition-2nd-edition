<p id="P70010170200000000000000000038BD" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000038BD" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a05aafabae8290e6a0a94f474a946dd79f61769a2">Despite these disagreements, there is a growing consensus among economists and politicians that the inflation control targeting is an effective compromise between the hands-off emphasis on rules and the hands-on emphasis on government discretion. Since the Bank of Canada adopted inflation targeting, the practice has spread to central banks in Israel, Scandinavia, Spain, Australia, and elsewhere. Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada, who is now the governor of the Bank of England, is implementing inflation targeting there, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is also moving toward inflation targeting.</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000038BE" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000038BE" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a1fa86d1ac2cb9ce22d1a915cd1f5d66157e06441">There are three reasons behind the growing consensus in Canada. First, the government and the Bank of Canada <i>jointly</i> set the inflation control target, while the largely independent Bank of Canada <i>alone</i> conducts the monetary policy to achieve that target. This compromise combines accountability to voters (favoured by the hands-on camp) with a minimum role for government politicians in conducting monetary policy (favoured by the hands-off camp).</p>
<p id="P70010170200000000000000000038BF" data-uri="M11_COHE5320_02_SE_C11.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000038BF" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a9fb29fd5d4e7d0a9093cf29e370137f3959dfe93">Second, the inflation control target is a fixed rule (favoured by the “Yes, Hands-Off” camp), but has the effect of stabilizing business cycles (favoured by the “No, Hands-On” camp). With an inflation control target, the Bank of Canada automatically takes policy actions to counter an inflationary boom (by raising interest rates to step on the brakes) or a recessionary bust (by lowering interest rates to step on the accelerator).</p>

Both see a role for monetary policy adjustments in avoiding cycles of boom and bust and keeping the economy on the road to steady growth in living standards, full employment, and stable prices.</p>

Some hands-on followers of Keynes want lower unemployment in the short run at the expense of higher inflation. But most of the “No, Hands-On” camp thinks that the short-run benefits of lower unemployment are not enough to outweigh the long-run costs of having to crush unleashed inflation expectations — a long, painful period of recession and high unemployment. Both camps agree on the value of an inflation control target in anchoring inflation expectations.</p>
