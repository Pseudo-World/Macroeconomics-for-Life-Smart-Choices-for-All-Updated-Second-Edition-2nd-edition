She asks, “How many hours will you work if I pay you $15 an hour?” After you answer, she asks, “How many hours will you work if I pay you $20 an hour?” If you are like most people, you will work more hours at $20 an hour than at $15 an hour. The higher wage is an <i>incentive</i> for you to supply a greater quantity of labour. That is the law of supply (section 3.3).</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003BFD" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003BFD" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a4648cb19fbe59139b776448f7d69a5191500c985">A tax cut gives the same incentive as a wage increase. Your take-home pay, after the government deducts income tax, is always less than what your boss pays you. If the government cuts your income taxes, your take-home pay rises, just as if you had a raise.</p>

If the government cuts taxes on labour as well as on capital investments, the quantities of labour and capital inputs supplied to markets could increase, and then aggregate supply increases. Through incentive effects, called <a id="P7001017020000000000000000003BFF" class="keyword" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003BFF" epub:type="keyword" href="fileP70010170200000000000000000044F0.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000004719" data-offlinesupport="yes">supply-side effects</a>, a tax cut can increase aggregate supply and potential GDP.</p>

The supply-side effects are small because most people already work as many hours as they can, and don’t get much choice from their bosses over how long to work. More take-home pay may encourage a few more hours per week, but not many more.</p>
