There is no empirical evidence to support supply-siders’ claims that tax cuts have large effects on aggregate supply. Tax cuts certainly affect the economy, but most of that effect is through increased spending and aggregate demand, as we discussed in section 12.1.</p>

It is important to know about supply-side effects because many politicians are supply-siders. Politicians who favour a hands-off role for government often use supply-sider arguments to support tax cuts.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003C0F" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003C0F" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ad1b48f2585026ebcdadea1f7629a31c08867b434">The false argument they present goes like this: Tax cuts will <i>increase</i>, not decrease, government tax revenues. How is that possible? If tax cuts have ­powerful incentive effects, people will work many more hours and incomes will go up dramatically. Even though a lower tax rate means that the government gets a smaller portion from every dollar people earn, people are earning so many more dollars from longer hours worked that the total amount of taxes collected increases. Government tax revenues increase instead of decrease.</p>
