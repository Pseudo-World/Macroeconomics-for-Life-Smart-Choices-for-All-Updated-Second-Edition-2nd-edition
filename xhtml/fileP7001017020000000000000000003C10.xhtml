<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003C19" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003C19" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a0badebb31ab655ba6204afe4f6bd18823448f0cd">The horizontal axis measures the income tax rate, from zero to 100 percent. The vertical axis measures the total tax revenues that will be collected for each tax rate. At a zero tax rate there will be zero tax revenues. And at a 100 percent tax rate, there will also be zero tax revenues because no one has any incentive to work if the government takes everything. In between these extremes, as the tax rate rises from zero, tax revenues increase (the upward-sloping green part of the curve). Eventually, at tax rate <i>T</i>*, tax revenues are at a maximum. As rates rise beyond <i>T</i>*, the disincentive effects of further tax increases discourage work. People work so much less that their reduced incomes, even when taxed at a higher rate, produce decreasing tax revenues (the downward-sloping red part of the curve).<span class="pagebreak" id="P7001017020000000000000000003C1A" title="364" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003C1A" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span></p>

If that were true, a cut in the tax rate would increase tax revenues. President Reagan — a pioneering hands-off supply-sider — cut taxes in the 1980s expecting increases in tax revenues. Instead, tax revenues decreased. With tax revenues falling short of government spending, the U.S. government went heavily into debt. During Reagan’s presidency, the U.S. national debt (a concept coming in section 12.4) skyrocketed from US$700 billon to US$3 trillion. In Canada, former Ontario Premier Mike Harris was also a supply-sider whose tax cuts decreased tax revenues, despite claiming that revenues would increase.</p>

That means a tax cut decreases, not increases, tax revenues, which is what happened in the United States and Canada.</p>

Both cut taxes drastically expecting government revenues to increase. But as most economists predicted, revenues decreased, and their governments ran huge deficits.</p></div>
