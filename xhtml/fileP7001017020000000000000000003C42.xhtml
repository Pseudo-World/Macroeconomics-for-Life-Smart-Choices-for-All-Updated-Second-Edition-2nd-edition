<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003C44" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003C44" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/abb7b977adb97dabc2caa6986ba3c35fc9f9fe9c7">Every month you have income coming into your wallet, and spending going out. If your income and spending match, you have a <i>balanced budget</i>. If you are like most students, your spending is more than your income, so you have a <i>deficit</i> — an amount by which your spending exceeds your income for the month. You have to finance (get money to cover) your deficit by going into <i>debt</i> — borrowing from student loans, credit cards, or family. If you are lucky enough to have a month when your income is greater than your expenses, you have a <i>surplus</i> — an amount by which your income exceeds your spending for the month. You can use the surplus money to treat yourself (splurge for an extra movie?), to save, or to pay off some of your debts. Government budgets are similar.</p>
