The national debt goes back to the creation of Canada. In 1867, the national debt was $76 million, measured in 1867 prices. The national debt in 2017 was $631.9 billion, measured in 2017 prices. The national debt in any year is measured in the nominal prices of that year.</p>

The most meaningful measure of the national debt is the national debt as a percentage of GDP. This ratio eliminates complications of price changes and economic growth. <a class="xref" href="fileP7001017020000000000000000003D6B.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003D77" data-offlinesupport="yes"><span class="label">Figure </span><span class="number">12.11</span></a> shows Canada’s national debt as a percentage of GDP between 1926 and 2017.</p>

<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003D7F" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003D7F" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ad216fbf12a6fb55158a5cc1df642f0bb89c93147">The first two major spikes in the ratio of national debt to GDP were due to the Great Depression (when tax revenues fell and government spending increased) and World War II (due to government spending on the war effort). The big spike from the late 1970s until the mid-1990s was different. This increase was due to a long string of peacetime budget deficits, which kept adding to the accumulated national debt. Then, starting in 1996, the federal government cut spending dramatically, especially transfer payments to provincial governments. From 1997 to 2008, annual budget surpluses reduced both the amount of the national debt and the ratio of the national debt to GDP.</p>

This was much lower than the 2017 ratio for the United States (82 percent), the United Kingdom (80 percent), France (89 percent), Germany (43 percent), Italy (114 percent), or Japan (140 percent).</p>
