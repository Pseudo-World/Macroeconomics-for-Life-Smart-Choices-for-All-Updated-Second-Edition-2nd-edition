<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003D84" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003D84" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a295bae7a9bb818c972b71fb109e80808f39cdcb0">There are many numbers to consider when examining the national debt. Government debt as a percentage of GDP (31 percent), where Canada currently does well relative to other countries, is one number. That number is also much lower than Canada’s ratio during the Great Depression (74 percent) or World War II (113 percent).</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003D85" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003D85" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/afece9779a28b3d9eff9e05d9d5d12e47a27643c2">The amount of the national debt is another number. The national debt reached a new peak of $562.9 billion in 1997 (in 1997 prices). It was $463.7 billion in 2009 (in 2009 prices), but then rose as a result of the Global Financial Crisis all the way to $631.9 billion in 2017.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000003D86" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003D86" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/abf67fcb956563f82dc2de8bcc99aa2f2dd5cd04e">You often see calculations of the national debt as a dollar amount per Canadian. That number is the national debt divided by the population. For 2017 that number was $17 500 per person. In effect you and I and every other person in Canada “owed” $17 500. If I had that balance owing on my credit card, I would be worried! Should we, as citizens, be concerned about these numbers for the national debt? What do the numbers mean?</p>
