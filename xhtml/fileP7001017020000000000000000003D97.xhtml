The argument that the debt must be repaid is a myth, but what about the burden of interest payments?</p>

A key question is, who receives the interest payments? About 80 percent of the national debt is held by Canadians. That means the interest payments are mainly going to Canadians. So most interest payments are more of a redistribution of money than a burden on ­taxpayers. The taxes collected from all Canadians go, in part, to pay interest received by Canadian government bondholders. If more of the Canadian ­government bonds were held by non-Canadians, this argument would become more important. As it stands now, the interest payments on the national debt are not a serious problem for future generations.</p>
