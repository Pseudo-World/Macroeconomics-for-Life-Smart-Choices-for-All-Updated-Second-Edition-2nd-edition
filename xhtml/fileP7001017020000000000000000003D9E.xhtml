People taking on a mortgage or a car lease are going into debt. Businesses regularly issue bonds and go into debt to build new factories. Debt is a smart choice if the expected future profits or benefits from spending the borrowed money are greater than the interest costs on the loan.</p>

If the debt is used to finance infrastructure — such as roads, bridges, public transit, education, or communications networks — that improve productivity, lower costs, and provide positive externalities to the economy, most ­economists see a smart choice. And these improvements mostly benefit future generations. But if the debt is used simply to finance consumption, spent by politicians trying to win votes before an election, most economists see that as a problem.<span class="pagebreak" id="P7001017020000000000000000003DA5" title="375" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003DA5" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span></p>

The “Yes — Hands-Off” camp might disapprove, while the “No — Hands-On” camp clearly approves. So government debt can be a problem, but it can also be a smart choice. See Economics Out There (page <a class="pageref" href="fileP7001017020000000000000000003DA7.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003DF3" data-offlinesupport="yes">376</a>) for one unusual “Yes — Hands-Off” camp argument against government debt.</p>
