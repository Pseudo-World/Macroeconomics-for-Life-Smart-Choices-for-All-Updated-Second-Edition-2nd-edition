If you don’t pay at least the interest owing on your debt, then you have to borrow more to pay the interest, which increases your debt. The balance on your credit card grows. The next month you have to pay interest on this larger balance. It is easy to get caught in this vicious cycle. You may never get out of debt.</p>

Her original balance was $5000. The credit card company charges 2 percent interest per month (don’t you wish?). After four payments, she has paid $200 but now owes $5202 — she is deeper in debt in month four than she was in month one.</p>

Persistent yearly deficits increased the national debt, which increased interest payments. Larger interest payments lead to larger yearly ­deficits. At the end of 1996, interest payments on the national debt reached $42.4 billion for the year — too high to be sustained.</p>

To put that number in perspective, interest payments on the national debt in 1996 took 36 cents of every dollar the government collected in revenues. That left only 64 cents of every tax dollar to spend on all government programs. The $42.4 billion interest bill was more money than the government spent that year on all transfers to Canadians, including Employment Insurance, Canada Pension Plan, Old Age Security, and national defence <i>combined</i>. That interest bill on the national debt represented 30 percent of all government spending. In 1996, the government, recognizing the national debt as a problem, began paying it down. By 2017, public debt charges had fallen to 8 percent of all government spending (see <a class="xref" href="fileP7001017020000000000000000003C5F.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003C63" data-offlinesupport="yes"><span class="label">Figure </span><span class="number">12.9</span></a>, page <a class="pageref" href="fileP7001017020000000000000000003C5F.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003C61" data-offlinesupport="yes">366</a>).<span class="pagebreak" id="P7001017020000000000000000003DF3" title="376" data-uri="M12_COHE5320_02_SE_C12.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000003DF3" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"></span></p>
