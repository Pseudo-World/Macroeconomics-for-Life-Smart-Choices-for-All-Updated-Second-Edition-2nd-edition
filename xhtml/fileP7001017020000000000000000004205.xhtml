Each of us, as consumers, benefits from slightly lower prices of imported products and services. The slightly higher prices caused by protectionism are not easily noticed. Even if consumers realized, for example, they were paying five percent more for a product because of tariffs, quotas, or subsidies, most would not feel strongly enough to pressure politicians.</p>

A small number of businesses and workers in import-competing industries lose from freer trade, but the loss for each is large. The unequal distribution of the gains and losses creates political pressures for protectionism to help those who lose from international trade.</p>

Many such businesses and workers in import-competing industries could lose their lifetime investments and their jobs. Facing great losses, those affected put as much political pressure as possible on politicians for tariffs, quotas, or subsidies. They often succeed in getting government to protect them from the increased competition and creative destruction of international trade.</p>

The hands-off camp argues that ­protectionist policies are a government failure that is a bigger problem than market failure.</p>
<p id="P700101702000000000000000000420D" data-uri="M13_COHE5320_02_SE_C13.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000420D" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/af448b49f4a4c5b0c649e09839824a9d1e1fec8d5">Competition from any new market, even within Canada, threatens existing industries. There is even pressure on provincial governments to provide ­protection against Canadian businesses and workers in other provinces. Many provinces require government purchases to come only from businesses within the province, and government jobs to go only to provincial residents.</p>
<p id="P700101702000000000000000000420E" data-uri="M13_COHE5320_02_SE_C13.xhtml#P700101702000000000000000000420E" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ac34914b5ff7709476e2cefa7c4f4ec162cfdc64a">In 1994, the Canadian provinces signed the Agreement on Internal Trade to prevent provinces from erecting new trade barriers and to reduce existing ones. Nonetheless, some Canadian businesses claim that trade between provinces is still more difficult than trade between Canada and the United States!</p>
