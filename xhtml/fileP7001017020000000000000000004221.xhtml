<p id="P7001017020000000000000000004223" data-uri="M13_COHE5320_02_SE_C13.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000004223" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a488104c2f5b241a3ecf011e82d06084a1dc11d06">When Canada entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, many tariffs and quotas were eliminated among Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Many people predicted a “giant sucking sound” from jobs draining out of Canada and the United States into Mexico, because wages for labour were so much lower there. That did not happen.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000004224" data-uri="M13_COHE5320_02_SE_C13.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000004224" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a857dfe9b9a606ee495adc0af672068b8f0214986">Low-skill, low-wage jobs requiring little education did move to Mexico. But the evidence suggests that the total number of jobs in Canada has increased because of greater exports to expanded North American markets. The mistake in this argument about competing with cheap foreign labour is the focus on absolute cost and absolute advantage, instead of comparative advantage. While Mexico has a comparative advantage for some products, Canada has a comparative advantage for others. Mexico too has benefited from the mutual gains from trade.</p>
