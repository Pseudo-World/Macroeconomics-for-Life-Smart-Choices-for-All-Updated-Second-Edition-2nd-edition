Specialization, trade, competition, and connected international markets will, they argue, create a tide of wealth that will eventually lift up all countries. These free-trade policies come directly from the hands-off camp’s answer, “Yes — Markets Self-Adjust” to the fundamental macroeconomic question:</p>

Those conditions require governments to enforce contracts and property rights — cracking down on pirated software, DVDs, and low-cost copies of expensive pharmaceutical drugs. Other hands-off conditions include removing regulations from labour markets, eliminating protectionist tariffs and quotas to allow imports from developed countries, lowering taxes on businesses to encourage private ­investment, and privatizing state-run industries — returning those industries to private businesses.</p>
<p id="P7001017020000000000000000004260" data-uri="M13_COHE5320_02_SE_C13.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000004260" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/ac640c10781f2d643c772979718f5f99158bd11c1">Economists usually support freer trade and a prominent role for markets. But these hands-off views were especially strong during the 1990s. That decade saw the collapse of state communism in East Germany and the USSR, and the failure of their notoriously inefficient state-run industries. There was also ­widespread corruption among many governments of developing countries. Hands-on policies do not succeed if governments cannot be trusted to spend loan money on the people and projects that need it most. Government failure seemed a bigger problem than market failure. Much evidence supported a hands-off position.</p>
