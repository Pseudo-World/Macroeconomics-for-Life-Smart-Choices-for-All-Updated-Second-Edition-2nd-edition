When we hear of the low pay and working conditions in sweatshops, our first thoughts — like those of the activist quoted at the start — may be that these workers are being exploited in the interest of corporate profits.</p>

One woman, Liang Ying, who fled to the Shenzhen factory zone in southern China, felt almost anything was better than life on the family rubber farm:</p>

It has to be done before daybreak, otherwise the sunshine will evaporate the rubber juice. If you were me, what would you prefer, the factory or the farm?”</p>

Are workers’ lives better, or worse, compared to a situation without ­globalization, trade, and the factory jobs that follow? This is the same question behind the Jill and Marie example — are they better off with specialization and trade, or better off being self-sufficient? Behind the law of supply (<a class="xref" href="../xhtml/fileP7001017020000000000000000000C6C.xhtml#P7001017020000000000000000000C6C" data-offlinesupport="yes"><span class="label">section </span><span class="number">3.1</span></a>) is the basic idea that to hire labour (or any other input), businesses must pay at least the value of the best alternative use of the worker’s time.</p>

What looks like ­poverty to us, and is poverty by Western standards, is a rising standard of living for the workers measured by their standards.</p>
