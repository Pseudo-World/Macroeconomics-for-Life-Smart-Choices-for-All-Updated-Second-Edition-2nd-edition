<p id="P70010170200000000000000000042CC" data-uri="M13_COHE5320_02_SE_C13.xhtml#P70010170200000000000000000042CC" resource="http://purl.org/pearson/asset/a118568cac4833e85cc1cd0d6fa3b359aa559da1b">The hands-on position believes government in all countries has a responsibility to maintain a social safety net to support the welfare of citizens left behind by trade and markets — especially by labour markets that determine incomes. Specialization, trade, and creative destruction — whether within a country or between countries — always creates winners and losers. In Canada, there are many government programs to assist those who lose from expanded trade. There are Employment Insurance benefits for the unemployed, job retraining programs, social assistance payments, and health-care benefits that do not depend upon a person having a job.</p>

Social safety net programs cost money that governments in poor countries may not have. But even if those governments wanted to create such programs, the strong hands-off ­policies of the World Bank and the IMF in the 1990s restricted their ability to operate or finance — through higher taxes — social safety net programs. The strong hands-off policies for labour markets also discouraged government regulation of working conditions. Bureaucrats and policymakers at the World Bank and IMF, rather than local governments, influenced decisions about local social programs.</p>
