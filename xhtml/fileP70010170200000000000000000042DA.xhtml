What is striking is the support it seems to give to the anti-globalization critics.</p>

Rich countries’ subsidies encourage wasteful use of energy and natural resources, and harm the environment. . . . rich countries’ protection of intellectual property discriminates unfairly against the developing world. And without a doubt, rich countries’ approach to financial regulation offers implicit subsidies to their banks and encourages reckless lending; it results, time and again, in financial crises in rich and poor countries alike.</p>

[Critics] are right to deplore this. But undue influence is hardly new in democratic politics; it has not been created by globalisation forcing governments to bow down. . . . If allowed to, all governments are happy to seek political advantage by granting preferences.</p>

Some of the poorest countries in the world are in Africa. The cotton-growing industry in West Africa, where the climate is ideal for growing cotton, is poverty-stricken. The problem is that the U.S government pays Texas farmers a domestic subsidy for growing cotton of up to 19 cents on a 59 cent pound of cotton. If Texas farmers had to produce without that subsidy, West African cotton would be competitive on world markets. But with the ­subsidy to U.S. farmers, the world price of cotton is less than what it takes for the West African farmers to make a living.</p>
