In response, she decided to travel the world, following the globally integrated production path of a T-shirt. She bought the T-shirt in Florida. It was made from Texas cotton and manufactured in China. She wanted to determine whether the accusations of the student activist about the harmful effects of globalization were justified.</p>

I would tell her to appreciate what markets and trade had accomplished for all of the sisters in time who have been liberated by life in a sweatshop, and that she should be careful about dooming anyone to life on the farm. I would tell her that the poor suffer more from exclusion from politics than from the perils of the market, and that if she has activist energy left over it should be focused on including people in politics rather than shielding them from markets.</p>

Those tariffs, quotas, and domestic subsidies, she argues, force prices below subsistence levels for producers in poorer countries. The ­resulting unfavourable terms of trade and poverty are due to government protectionist policies.</p>

Instead, she suggests opposing protectionist policies while supporting safety net policies in all countries. It is a combination of hands-off and hands-on.</p>
